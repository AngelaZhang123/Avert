    <string name="EQ22c_toast">Nice! You should always get low so that the earthquake can not knock you over</string>
    <string name="EQ23a_toast">You are correct, but you should still be on the lookout for possible aftershocks</string>
    <string name="EQ23b_toast">Although there can be aftershocks, you are not in immediate danger so you are free to move</string>
    <string name="EQ23c_toast">Great choice! There is always the possibility of an aftershock and you should be prepared for it</string>
